# Large model files (Optional but good practice if models are very large)
# If your .h5 or .joblib files are over 100MB, you should consider
# using Git LFS (Large File Storage) instead of tracking them directly.
# For now, we assume they are under the limit. If not, you could add:
# models/*.h5
# models/*.joblib
